``the database that was implemented for testing purposes was mysql but the tester could use forks like mariaDB or other slq


the connection to the database is in the php / init.php directory

Modifications and selections to the database can be made from functions.php


the area of the images is provided from the point of view of object-oriented javascript

feel free to modify what you require

the views are modularized and can be even more modularized to add things like sectors where you place advertising to monetize the web and even add other mobile implementations such as google amp or use React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js or whatever you want``

``about the name of the app is due to a famous Russian astronaut``
